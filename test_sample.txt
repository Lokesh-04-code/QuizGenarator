Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data.
Deep Learning uses neural networks with many layers to analyze complex patterns.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables computers to understand human language.
Computer Vision allows machines to interpret and make decisions from visual data.
Reinforcement Learning is a type of ML where agents learn by trial and error.
Supervised Learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions.
Unsupervised Learning finds hidden patterns in data without labels.
Transfer Learning reuses a model trained on one task for another related task.
GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, a large language model architecture.
